        "-; In simple linear regression, the slope m is calculated using the formula: m = r * (sy / sx), where r is the correlation coefficient, sy is the standard deviation of the dependent variable (y), and sx is the standard deviation of the independent variable (x). This formula essentially converts the correlation coefficient back into the units of the original variables, reflecting the change in the dependent variable for each unit change in the independent variable.\n",

        "-; In simple linear regression, the coefficient of determination (R²) indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable.

        "-;The primary distinction between simple and multiple linear regression lies in the number of independent variables used to predict a dependent variable. Simple linear regression employs one independent variable, while multiple linear regression utilizes two or more independent variables. This difference allows multiple regression to model more complex relationships and potentially improve predictive accuracy by considering the combined effects of multiple factors.\n",

        "Heteroscedasticity in a multiple linear regression model refers to the non-constant variance of the error term across different values of the independent variables.

One-hot encoding creates binary columns for each category, while label encoding assigns a unique integer to each category. Dummy coding is another approach, similar to one-hot encoding but potentially reducing multicollinearity. Analytics Vidhya also mentions using binary encoding and target encoding. Additionally, ordinal encoding can be used if categories have a natural ordering.\n",

        "-;The interpretation of the intercept in simple linear regression and multiple linear regression differs because of the added complexity of multiple predictor variables in the latter. In simple regression, the intercept is the predicted value of the dependent variable when the independent variable is zero. In multiple regression, the intercept is the predicted value of the dependent variable when all independent variables are zero. This means that the intercept in multiple regression represents a more general scenario, as it's the predicted outcome when no independent variables are contributing to the effect.\n",

        "-;A large standard error for a regression coefficient indicates that the estimated coefficient is less precise and more variable across different samples. It suggests that the true population value of the coefficient is more likely to be significantly different from the estimated value. In other words, there's less confidence in the precision of the coefficient estimate.\n",

        "-;Heteroscedasticity, or non-constant variance of errors, can be identified in residual plots by looking for a fan or cone shape, where the spread of residuals widens or narrows as the fitted values increase. Addressing heteroscedasticity is crucial because it violates the assumptions of linear regression, potentially leading to unreliable standard errors and confidence intervals, and affecting the validity of hypothesis tests.\n",

        "-;A high R² and low adjusted R² in a multiple linear regression model suggests that the model has a strong fit to the training data, but the predictive power might be weaker than indicated by R². This can be due to including irrelevant variables that inflate R² without improving the model's ability to generalize to new data.\n",
